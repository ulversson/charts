### App needs postgres database to run. Please have a look in config/database.yml file

### To run the tests
``` bundle exec rake ``` 

### Chart configuration is stored in 
` config/charts.yml ` 

I used ticker api for bitcoin/ethereum charts. For simplicity of this task I haven't used live chart. Nasdaq Chart shows last 100 days.
